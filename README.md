# Ledge Detector
Reference code for implentation of ledge detection from a shelved project.
The primary intent was to experiment with tilted ledge detection and approach what developers of Dying Light did for their ledge detection system.

**Note: original project was built around a paid character controller and paid visualization tools that cannot be shared so an abstract character actor stub has been provided and all debug visualization has been stripped.**
